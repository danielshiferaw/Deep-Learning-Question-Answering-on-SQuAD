# Deep-Learning-Question-Answering-on-SQuAD
Main code for deep learning model for question answering on Stanford SQuAD dataset. Worked with Andrew Duffy and Eric Musyoka on assignment. Andrew and Eric worked on the Match-LSTM-like model, while I worked on the Dynamic Coattention Encoding-like model (whose code is highlighted here). qa_data.py processes and packages the data for training. qa_answer.py defines the Dynamic Coattention Encoding-like model, trains the model (code for executing training is commented out but left for reference), evaluates the model, stores model parameters, and tests the model (testing code is not commented out for reference). evaluate.py is official evaluation script for the Stanford SQUaAD dataset whose functions are called within qa_answer.py. The official research paper for the project is avaialable at this link: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/2737321.pdf
