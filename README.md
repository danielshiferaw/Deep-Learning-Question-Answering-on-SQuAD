# Deep-Learning-Question-Answering-on-SQuAD
Main code for deep learning model for question answering on Stanford SQuAD dataset. Worked with Andrew Duffy and Eric Musyoka on assignment. Andrew and Eric worked on the Match-LSTM-like model, while I worked on the Dynamic Coattention Encoding-like model.
