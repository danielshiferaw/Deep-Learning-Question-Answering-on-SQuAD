# Deep-Learning-Question-Answering-on-SQuAD
Just main code for now for deep learning model for question answering on Stanford SQuAD dataset. Worked with Andrew Duffy and Eric Musyoka [sic] on assignment. Andrew and Eric mainly worked on the Match-LSTM-like model, while I mainly worked on the Dynamic Coattention Encoding-like model.
